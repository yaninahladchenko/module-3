hours and a per hour payment. It should return a calculated payment. For example pay(1.5, 10) should return 15.
Write another class with the main method which will test the Accounting class by calling the pay method.

Write a method in Employee class which prints this information (method print() ). Also please make sure to create methods
which can set the name, surname and ID, also the Employee class should have at least two constructors. The first one
accepts name and surname and sets the ID to a random value, and another one just sets the ID to a random number. N.B.
You could use a class named Random in Java to get random numbers.
